 <p>Do you still remember the first piece of code you ever wrote? How far you've come and how much you've learned? I think it's important to acknowledge the fact, how mature your code has come along.</p>
 <p>Here I am going to share my thoughts and experience about "<em><strong>How to be an efficacious engineer</strong></em>" - being honest and explicit.</p>
 <p class="left">"Being efficacious" which means&nbsp;<em><strong><span>capable</span>&nbsp;<span>of</span>&nbsp;<span>having</span>&nbsp;<span>the</span>&nbsp;<span>desired</span>&nbsp;<span>result</span>&nbsp;<span>or</span>&nbsp;<span>effect on the surroundings.</span></strong></em></p>

   First, solve the problem. Then, write the code (John Johnson)
